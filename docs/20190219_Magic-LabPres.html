# Software as Magic

* [Our colour of magic: The open sourcery of fantastic R packages](https://github.com/MilesMcBain/rstudioconf_talk)

--

* Miles McBain: 
--

creator of the package *datapasta*

--

* R Users publicly called it by many names:

--

 * Witchcraft
   
--
 * Dark Sorcery
   
--
 * So f*cking magical

--

* Why though?

---

datapasta makes use of RStudio add-ins to allow users to copy and paste tabular data from the web into R data structures with a minimum of user action. My own notes from the talk include a line

`$$Magic =  \frac{Power}{Pain}$$`

So the more power something grants you relative to the pain of using it the more magical it feels

## A Litmus Test

The magic of 
--
_**tool**_ 
--
is that it grants you 
--
_**power**_ 
--
while saving you from 
--
_**pain**_


???
Who here knows about dplyr?

---
class: middle


The magic of 
--
_**dplyr**_ 
--
is that it grants you 
--
_**a vocabulary to wrangle data**_ 
--
while saving you from 
--
_**mindless typing, reading documentation, and learning SQL**_

---
class: middle

The magic of 
--
_**tinytex**_ 
--
is that it grants you 
--
_**the things you need to knit PDF**_ 
--
while saving you from 
--
_**a bloated 4GB install, arcane instructions, hunting through 90s websites**_

## Design Tool

The magic of _**my tool**_ is that it grants you _**power**_ while saving you from _**???**_

???

* Cram as many pain points as you can into that '???' to increase the magical nature of your tool.  
* Miles mentioned three specific pain points were mentioned that I'd like to run over here


---
# Saving Typing

--
* Specific to R but...

---
# Saving Typing

* Pipeable functions

--

* Autocomplete friendly names

--

* Do it for the user

???

* No more repeated typing of variable names
* Easier tab completion means faster typing
* Use Rstudio Add-ins and Templates
---

# Saving Reading

* Intuitive names

--

 * Less searching through documentation for desired functions or arguments

--

* Conform to conventions

--

 * Adhere to standard input and ouput formats where possible

--

* Be flexible

--

 * Rigid interfaces require more trial and error: 
--
more reading documentation, 
--
Stack Overflow, 
--
BioStars, 
--
etc...


???

* Users are going to want to compare the results to what they know
* Minimizing the amount of reading a user has to do to start using a new tool will increase uptake

---
# Saving Decisions

* Appropriate defaults... 

--

 * Many argue against defaults


???

* "users will blindly run the tool without changing defaults and the resulting answer will be incorrect"
* We even say this ourselves

---
template: define

&gt; There is no such thing (yet) as an automated gearshift in short read mapping. It is all like stick-shift driving in San Francisco. In other words = running this tool with default parameters will probably not give you meaningful results. A way to deal with this is to understand the parameters by carefully reading the documentation and experimenting. Fortunately, Galaxy makes experimenting easy.

---

# Saving Decisions

* Appropriate defaults...
--
with validation.

--

 * Why does your tool give answers that the user can't discern the validity of?

--

 * eg. Bowtie2 -X parameter:
 
--
     * Max fragment length for valid paired-end alignments

--
     * Default value: 500

--
     * Typical Miseq read length is ~300 bases 

???

Genomics core 
When your tool relies on scoring read alignments done by Bowtie2 this results in a ton of low scoring results  
without any way of knowing the results are wrong unless you have known positive samples showing up negative

---
# Saving Decisions

* Appropriate defaults... with validation.

--

* Give them less

--

 * More options = more anxiety for making the right choices

--

 * Lower barrier for entry

???

* Argument against: Don't want a default here because users will blindly run the tool without changing defaults and the resulting answer will be incorrect
        - eg. Read mapping with smalt: we specifically warn users:
        &gt; There is no such thing (yet) as an automated gearshift in short read mapping. It is all like stick-shift driving in San Francisco. In other words = running this tool with default parameters will probably not give you meaningful results. A way to deal with this is to understand the parameters by carefully reading the documentation and experimenting. Fortunately, Galaxy makes experimenting easy.
        - eg. bowtie2: -X parameter (max insert size) defaults to 500, for our Illumina reads at 250+ bp per read this invalidates all the mapped read pairs resulting in incorrect scoring. 
    - Validation is the answer to the above argument:
        - Why does your tool give answers that the user can't discern the validity of?
        - eg. with the bowtie2 -X parameter the only indication something was wrong comes from examining the pileups after the fact visually, or when a known positive sample scores as negative. A simple warning message that a vast majority of paired-end reads mapped as improperly paired would have solved this.
- UIs and Dialogues: Galaxy / IRIDA
- Give them less:
    - More options = more anxiety for making the right choices
    - Create a low barrier to entry: less to originally learn prior to running the tool for the first time

# Encouraging a Magical Culture


* Learn from the users

--

 * They are directly in tune with their pain
 
--

* Often users are amateur developers

--

  * Create workarounds

# Encouraging a Magical Culture

* Learn from the users

 * They are directly in tune with their pain

* Often users are amateur developers

  * Create workarounds

--

* Great tools are often created by amateurs

--

 * R examples: *datapasta, ggplot, knitr*
 
--

 * The code may not be pretty but it does the job


???

- Learn from the users: they are directly in tune with user pain
- Living pain of having an analysis or a need that isn't met by available software or struggling through the indescipherable tools that are available
- These people can be amateur developers even though professional scientists and technicians
    - Often find workarounds that fufill the requirement they have but that have real drawbacks due to the way they are made
    - Eg. Mykrobe parser workflow - 300+ tool calls in Galaxy, down to one R script
- Some R examples:
    - Datapasta, ggplot, knitr were all created by students
- Encourage users to create tools to solve the problems they are facing. 
    - Then steal those ideas wholesale.

# A Couple More Slides from Karl Broman

---
### Warning messages
- Make them:
    - Clear
    - Concise
    - Informative
    - Meaningful
    - Suggest a next step

---

### Tests
&gt; "I don't need tests, I have users." - Karl Broman

--

&gt; "If you use software that lacks automated tests, you are the tests." - Jenny Bryan

---
 
### Code inconsistencies
- Consistent naming schemes for 
    - functions
    - arguments
    - modules

---

### Documentation

Tailored Tutorials &gt; User Guide &gt; Examples &gt; Formal Documentation

1. Users want to see your tool doing exactly what they want to do. 
    - Plug in data and go.
    - First importance should be showing how your users will actually use the tool
2. General user guide second
3. Examples to support the user guide for edge cases
4. No one seems to read it unless something is going wrong

---

### User support

No question is too insignificant
