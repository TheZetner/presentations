# Upcoming Courses

* ASV Analysis with DADA2
--
 \- beta testers needed!

???

The DADA2 tutorial is a walk-through of the key steps required for ASV inference from fastq data. 
We're currently looking for beta testers with domain knowledge to run through the tutorial and provide feedback. 
If that interests you, please come talk to me afterwards or email adrian.zetner@canada.ca.
